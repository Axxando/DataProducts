# README file for "The Online Levenshtein Distance Calculator"

The Levenshtein distance is the minimal number of insertions, deletions and substitutions needed to transform one string into another. It's a measure of "dissimilarity" of two texts.

To try it out just enter a start word (e.g. "Hello" in English) and an end word (e.g. "Hallo" in German) and hit the submit button.

This online implementation of the algorithm has been created by Andreas von Ballmoos for JHU's "Developing Data Products" on Coursera in May 2015
